commands

commandname

commandtext

aliases


commands.0.name = string
commands.0.text = string
commands.0.alias.0 = string
commands.0.alias.1 = string


e.g.

commands.0.name = status
commands.0.text = it's down forever! :(
commands.0.alias.0 = webstatus
commands.1.name = hello
commands.1.text = hello world!
commands.2.name = coffee
commands.2.text = here's some coffee
commands.2.alias.0 = drink
commands.2.alias.1 = refreshments


Find command

Check command -> check aliases -> check next command -> check aliases

implementation

bool command.matches("text") returns true if matches name or aliases, else false
for each command, do command.matches("commandtext")

later, register commands and aliases with table, do table.find, reference command class

use initialization function to load commands from config. do not save commands to config until shutdown, limit hard disk access.
